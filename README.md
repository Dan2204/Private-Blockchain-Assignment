# Private Blockchain Application

This is my submission for the 'Create your own private blockchain' course.

The course is 4 years old, and I found the dependencies wern't very functional on my mac.
I deleted all modules and started again, installing fresh versions. The project started working fine.

I ended up using Electrum to sign the message and tested it all through Postman.
All is working and all required functionality exists.

I am pretty confident all rubric items have been met.
